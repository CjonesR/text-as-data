# Text Analysis


### Evaluation Criteria (same for all projects)

**Code/Approach** (50%): Does the program produce useful results? Is it properly documented with `#comments` and `doc strings`? Does it use appropriate data structures?

**Write Up** (50%): Is it clear what was done and why? Does it adequately cite resources used? Does it adequately cite the linguistics literature? Does it include some evaluation? Is there any analysis of errors? Does it point out any remaining issues? Is it formatted correctly?

Assessment problems are generally open ended -- it is not expected that the student can solve them fully: the goal is to see how they approach the problem and understand it.

There’s a great moment in John Scalzi’s _Redshirts_ where statistical analysis is mentioned, and it comes down to comparing texts:

“So what you’re saying is all this is impossible,” Dahl said.

Jenkins shook his head. “Nothing’s impossible,” he said. “But some things are pretty damned unlikely. This is one of them.”

“How unlikely?” Dahl asked.

“In all my research there’s only one spaceship I’ve found that has even remotely the same sort of statistical patterns for away missions,” Jenkins said. He rummaged through the graphic elements again, and then threw one onto the screen. They all stared at it.

Duvall frowned. “I don’t recognize this ship,” she said. “And I thought I knew every type of ship we had. Is this a Dub U ship?”

“Not exactly,” Jenkins said. “It’s from the United Federation of Planets.”
Duvall blinked and focused her attention back at Jenkins. “Who are they?” she asked.

“They don’t exist,” Jenkins said, and pointed back at the ship. “And neither does this. This is the starship Enterprise. It’s fictional. It was on a science fictional drama series. And so are we.”

Compare to Moliere's gentleman or something from Lewis Carroll's Alice. There's something strange about realizing that all the things you've been writing are available for analysis.

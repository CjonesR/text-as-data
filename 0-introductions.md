## Introductions 

In the first two weeks we make all the usual introductions: course and participants (all of us in the room). We then begin the first of many considerations of what it means to quantify qualitative things like words from a very “big picture” point of view, if only to remind ourselves that for every insight, there is a blindness. The good news is that there are many questions to ask, and many ways to ask them.

0.1 **Course Overview**. All the usual things.

0.2. **Ethical Considerations**. There are all sorts of considerations of the ethical implications for data, not the least of which is Cathy O’Neil’s _Weapons of Math Destruction_. The readings for this period are fairly short, seven pages here and six pages there, but they come at the topic from very different angles. Enjoy the contract and come prepared to talk about your response (and how that connects you to a particular kind of audience).

* [Data Feminism][]: Download the introduction and read it. Our discussion will focus on the last section, entitled “Data and Power” (11-17).
* [Intelligence Community Directives][]: download 



0.3. **Analytics Unplugged**. We analyze a short story *sans ordinateur*. Our considerations include: summarization, named entities, (and with a little computing) term frequencies.**Action(s)**: In groups, create a meaningful visualization of text based on a quantification of your choosing.
**Follow-Up**: ["The Zipf Mystery"][]

0.4/5. **Files**. If we need to, we can review  the basics of loading text from files as well as scraping sites to get files. We can discuss using a shell command like `xyz` as well as Python libraries for doing similar things. (It's possible we will cover `BeautifulSoup` here: but we may come back to getting data once we have worked with some provided materials.)

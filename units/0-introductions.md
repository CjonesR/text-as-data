## Introductions 

In the first two weeks we make all the usual introductions: course and participants (all of us in the room). We then begin the first of many considerations of what it means to quantify qualitative things like words from a very ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù point of view, if only to remind ourselves that for every insight, there is a blindness. The good news is that there are many questions to ask, and many ways to ask them.

0.1 **Course Overview**. All the usual things.

0.2. **Ethical Considerations**. There are all sorts of considerations of the ethical implications for data, not the least of which is Cathy O‚ÄôNeil‚Äôs _Weapons of Math Destruction_. The readings for this period are fairly short, seven pages here and six pages there, but they come at the topic from very different angles. Enjoy the contract and come prepared to talk about your response (and how that connects you to a particular kind of audience).

* [Data Feminism][]: Download the introduction and read it. Our discussion will focus on the last section, entitled ‚ÄúData and Power‚Äù (11-17).
* [Intelligence Community Directives][]: download [ICD 203](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD-203_TA_Analytic_Standards_21_Dec_2022.pdf) - Analytic Standards and read it. Our discussion will focus on D.6.3.e.(1-9).

If these kinds of larger considerations pique your curiosity, there are a number of books now out. I like Erica Thompson‚Äôs _Escape from Model Land_ and Brandeis Hill Marshall‚Äôs _Data Conscience_. There is also *A Primer on Powerful Numbers: Selected Readings in the Social Study of Publc Data and Official Numbers*, which is available from [Data & Society](https://datasociety.net/library/a-primer-on-powerful-numbers-selected-readings-in-the-social-study-of-public-data-and-official-numbers/). 

**Note**: We will read Bender et al‚Äôs ‚ÄúOn the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? ü¶ú‚Äù ([Bender et al 2021][]) later this semester when we get to transformers and large language models.

0.3. **Analytics Unplugged**. Can we compute a short story by hand? Our considerations include: summarization, named entities, (and with a little computing) term frequencies.**Action(s)**: In groups, create a meaningful visualization of text based on a quantification of your choosing.
**Follow-Up**: ["The Zipf Mystery"][]

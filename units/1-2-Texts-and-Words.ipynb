    "In the beginning of the first chapter of _[Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html)_, the authors have you download and import a number of prepared texts, which the rest of the chapter then uses. We already have a text, so this notebook starts off by importing the `nltk` library and then making it into the particular kind of *Text* that many `nltk` operations expect. For now, simply run the code in the first cell and let it set up Richard Connell's \"The Most Dangerous Game\" as well as Joseph Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_ as two text objects you can then explore.\n",
